# __How to Upload Your Data to the ThanoSQL Workspace__ 

The ThanoSQL workspace's users can upload data in two ways, as shown below.

!!! note "To upload data"
    1. Uploading your local data into your workspace environment
    2. Uploading local data by SFTP server connection using a private key

## __1. Uploading your local data into a workspace environment__

Follow these steps to upload local data to the ThanoSQL workspace:

!!! note ""
    1. Log into the ThanoSQL console
    2. Click the Upload button. (Same as the Jupyter Lab method)
    3. Select the file to upload.

!!! warning "Uploading Precaution" 
    Uploading a large number of files with multiple selections can cause problems since multiple connection requests occur at once. When processing large amounts of data, be sure to upload it as a zip file.

## __2. Uploading local data by SFTP server connection using a private key__

!!! note "What is SFTP(Secure File Transfer Protocol)?"
    An interactive file transfer program with a user interface similar to File Transfer Protocol(FTP). However, SFTP uses SSH File Transfer Protocol(FTP) to create a secure connection to the server.

!!! danger ""
    - SFTP supports only ubuntu linux 
    - Though, most commands available for the linux cli are usable with SFTP, some commands are unavailable.

Follow these steps to connect to the remote server and upload data.


### __STEP 1. Verify your private key and ID__

SFTP connection requires a private key and ID. If you enter 'My Profile' at the top of the webpage, you can check or reissue your private key. Enter the workspace name for the ID required for SFTP connection.

The private key follows the format below:

```pem

-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```
### __STEP 2. Register private key locally - creating a pem file__

Create a file called 'key.pem' using the vim command in your local environment. Paste the private key issued in the previous step to the generated file.

```bash
$ vim key.pem
```

### __STEP 3. Change the permission of the pem file__

Change the permission of the private key registered pem file in your local environment to read.

```bash
$ chmod 400 key.pem
```

### __STEP 4. Connect to SFTP server__
After changing the permission of the file from your local environment, Connect to SFTP server.

!!! warning ""
    To connect to the SFTP server, you need the absolute path of the pem file and workspace name you checked in STEP 1.

```bash
sftp -i [the absolute path of the pem file] [name of workspace]@engine.thanosql.ai
```

Once connected, you will get a screen as shown below.

### __STEP 5. Access data files__

Once the SFTP connection is complete, locate the current location and access the authorized 'drive' folder. (You cannot access any other folder because you only have authority over the 'drive' folder.)

```bash
sftp> pwd
sftp> cd /drive
```

### __STEP 6. Transfer folders or files__

Check the remote working directory and the local working directory, and transfer the file.

```bash
put image_folder
```

By following the above steps, you can transfer image files in the local working directory 'image_folder' to the remote working directory '/drive'.
