To use ThanoSQL's REST API, you must issue your own token.
To issue tokens, you can simply go to the [ThanoSQL web page](https://thanosql.ai/en) and receive them by following the procedure below.
Please note that API tokens can be newly issued, but if they are newly issued, previously issued tokens can no longer be used.

First, log in from the [ThanoSQL web page](https://thanosql.ai/en), and then tap the console button in the upper right corner to enter the workspace.

Pressing the GET API_TOKEN button in the upper right corner of your workspace automatically creates an API token and copies it to the clipboard. You can use all of ThanoSQL's REST APIs using the generated API token.
