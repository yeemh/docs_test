# **ThanoSQL Algorithm Query Syntax**

## Preface

- Updated Date : {{ git_revision_date_localized }}

The query syntax retrieves one or more expressions and returns a table of calculated results. This page describes the syntax for the algorithm query used by ThanoSQL.

**Notation Conventions**

- Parentheses `()` indicate ^^literal^^ parentheses.
- Braces {} are used to bind combinations of options.
- The square bracket `[]` indicates an optional clause.
- An ellipsis following a comma in square brackets [ , ... ] means that the preceding item can be repeated as a comma-separated list.
- The vertical bar `|` represents the logic `OR`.
- VALUE means a value.

!!! note ""
    **literal** : A fixed or unchangeable value, also known as Constant.
    > Each literal has a special data type, such as a column, in the table.

## **1. AutomlClassifier Algorithm**

### **BUILD MODEL Query Syntax**

Use this "**BUILD MODEL**" query syntax to develop an AI model.
The "**BUILD MODEL**" expression allows you to learn defined data sets through query_expr after "**AS**".

```sql
query_statement:
    query_expr

BUILD MODEL (model_name_expression)
USING AutomlClassifier
OPTIONS (
    expression [ , ...]
    )
AS
(query_expr)
```

**OPTIONS clause**

```sql
OPTIONS(
    target = column_name,
    [impute_type = {"simple" | "iterative"}],
    [features_to_drop = [column_name, ...]],
    [datetime_attribs = [column_name, ...]],
    [outlier_method = {"pca" | "iso" | "knn"}],
    [time_left_for_this_task = VALUE],
    [overwrite = {True | False}]
    )
```

The "**OPTIONS**" clause allows you to change the value of the parameters in the AutomlClassifier from their default values. The meaning of each parameter is as follows.

- "target" : Set the column that is the target value for the classification prediction model in the data table.
- "impute_type" : Sets how empty values are handled in the data table.(DEFAULT : "simple")
> "simple" : For empty values, categorical variables are treated as the least value and continuous variables as the mean.  
> "iterative" : For empty values, process by applying an algorithm that predicts through the remaining properties.
- "features_to_drop" : Sets the columns that are not available for learning in the data table.
- "datetime_attribs" : Sets the column corresponding to the date in the data table.
- "outlier_method" : Sets how outliers are handled in the data table.(DEFAULT : "iso")
> "pca" : Detect abnormal samples by reducing and restoring dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for a given data table.  
> "iso" : For a given data table, use Isolation Forest to randomly branch the data table on a tree basis, isolate all observations, and detect abnormal samples. (It works efficiently on data sets with many variables.)  
>  "knn" : A K-NN-based approach detects abnormal samples based on the distance between each data.
- "time_left_for_this_task" : Indicates the time it takes to find a suitable classification prediction model. The larger the value, the more likely it is to find a suitable model (DEFAULT : 300)
- "overwrite" :Sets the presence or absence of an overwriteable model with the same name if it exists. If true, the existing model will be replaced with the new model. (DEFAULT : False)

**BUILD MODEL Query Syntax example**

You can find examples of using the algorithm query syntax in the [Creating a classification model using Auto-ML](/en/tutorials/thanosql_ml/classification/automl_classification/).

    [overwrite = {True | False}]

    )
```

> "pca" : Detect abnormal samples by reducing and restoring dimensions using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for a given data table.  
> "iso" : For a given data table, Isolation Forest is used to randomly branch the data table on a tree basis, isolate all observations, and detect abnormal samples (even on a data set with many variables)  
> "knn" :A K-NN-based approach detects abnormal samples based on the distance between each data.
- "time_left_for_this_task" : Indicates the time it takes to find a suitable classification prediction model. The larger the value, the more likely it is to find a suitable model (DEFAULT : 300)
