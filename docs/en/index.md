## **Definition of ThanoSQL**

ThanoSQL is an integrated platform that is capable of [query](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query) and AI (artificial intelligence) modeling both structured and unstructured data with only ^^SQL^^. You can apply the functions of ^^RDB (Relational Database)^^, AI, and Big Data Platform within one platform and significantly reduce inefficiencies that occur during AI-based digital transformation.

- ThanoSQL can query both structured and ^^unstructured data^^ with SQL alone and enables rapid AI modeling.
- By replacing the ^^lambda architecture^^-based unstructured big data platform with one ThanoSQL, development, deployment, and operation can be done in a single process.
- Based on big data processing and distributed parallel processing technology, data processing is more than twice as fast as before.

!!! note "Key Terminology Description"
    **RDB(Relational DataBase)** : It refers to a database based on a relational data model. Relational data models represent all data in a two-dimensional table as one of the necessary ways to organize the data. Typically, you can only handle structured data.<br>

    __SQL__ : It is a special purpose programming language designed to process data from the Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) and is also called a query language.

    __Unstructured Data__ : Data without an identifiable structure or architecture. Text, speech, and images are primarily applicable and do not follow a predefined data model, making them unsuitable for relational databases. However, this flexibility is scalable and unrestricted.
    Properly analyzed, unstructured data can be used for various applications and provide valuable [business intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence) insight.

    __Lambda Architecture__ : Because of the difficulty in analyzing a large amount of data in real-time, this method combines a data table that can be acquired in real-time with a batch table that has been calculated in advance at a particular time so that a certain amount of real-time analysis is possible even for large volumes of data.

## **Advantages of ThanoSQL**

AI-based digital transformation requires a wide range of implementation of knowledge and technology and continuous discovery of insight, such as various languages, frameworks, and lambda architecture-based big data platforms. These complex requirements gradually increase the difficulty of technology implementation and the complexity of the process, requiring a lot of manpower and time for development, deployment, and operation.

SmartMind significantly shortens the development period and eliminates inefficiencies by integrating various development/operation platforms, languages, and frameworks into one, ThanoSQL.

The figure below is a data engineering ecosystem map; it shows technologies for building data science and big data analysis systems at a glance. You can see that more than 60 tech stacks are used.

Using ThanoSQL, you don't need to know all of the tech stacks which are shown in the picture above. Using only SQL and Python, you can consistently produce good results much faster than developers (or data engineers) who know all of the tech stacks.

This means that developers (or data engineers) who can use ThanoSQL will inevitably have much higher competitiveness over developers (or data engineers) who cannot use ThanoSQL.
